Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras to predict customer churn in a bank based on historical data.

Overview
Dataset: Churn_Modelling.csv

Model: ANN with Dense layers

Objective: Classify whether a customer will leave the bank (churn) or not.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
Data preprocessing (handling categorical variables, feature scaling)

Neural Network built using Keras.Sequential

Hyperparameter tuning

Achieved ~85‚Äì87% accuracy

Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

Results
The model showed strong performance on validation data with consistent improvement after tuning.
